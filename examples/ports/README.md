# README

The examples in this directory are the [official SDL3 examples](https://examples.libsdl.org/SDL3/)
ported from C source code to V source code.

The first example (`01-clear`) has comments containing the original ported C source lines
above the corresponding V code to help clarify how the C source is ported.
Other examples may only have the original C source comments.

These are preserved for educational purposes and to aid navigation.
